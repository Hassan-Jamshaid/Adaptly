"""
Rule-based Fatigued detector.

DAiSEE has no fatigue dimension, so Fatigued cannot be a model class (see
PROJECT_CONTEXT section 4). It is derived here instead: sustained low eye
openness relative to the user's own calibrated baseline.

How the threshold is grounded
-----------------------------
`eye_openness` is the mean eye-aspect-ratio of both eyes. DAiSEE's Focused
population sits at mean 0.369, std 0.068. Calibration rebases each user onto
that scale (offset = user_baseline - reference), so after calibration a value
near 0.369 means "as open-eyed as an alert DAiSEE subject" and drifting below
it means this particular person's eyes are drooping relative to their own
alert baseline.

This only holds for calibrated users. Uncalibrated live EAR averages ~0.311
(section 4), which sits barely above the threshold — so an uncalibrated user
would trip the rule almost immediately. `update()` therefore refuses to run
without calibration rather than reporting a meaningless answer.

Blink robustness
----------------
Each window's value is the MEDIAN of its 10 frames, not the mean. A blink
drives EAR toward zero for a frame or two, and the route also substitutes
zero-vectors for any leading frames captured before the first face detection.
The frontend guarantees at least 7 of 10 frames contain a real face, so a
median over 10 values cannot be dragged below the threshold by either effect.

# Looking down at a keyboard drops the eyelids over the eyes, which lowers EAR
# exactly like drooping from tiredness does. Genuine fatigue means drooping eyes
# with the user still LOOKING AT THE SCREEN, so "looking down" windows are
# excluded from the history rather than counted as droop.
#
# MEASURED sign convention: head down => pitch delta POSITIVE.
# Tilting the head down foreshortens the lower face, so the projected
# nose-to-chin distance shrinks and pitch rises toward zero. Measured live at
# +8.84 with the head deliberately down.
#
# This was originally implemented with the opposite sign, carried over from the
# section 4 laptop-camera comparison (live -19.75 vs DAiSEE -13.38). That figure
# describes a CAMERA MOUNTING difference between two datasets, not what happens
# when one person tilts their head — so it was the wrong convention to reuse,
# and the gate never fired.
#
# Threshold sits well below the observed +8.84 so a moderate downward glance
# still trips it.

# Preferred gate: solvePnP pitch relative to the user's calibrated pose baseline.
# Verified against synthetic ground truth — looking down makes solvePnP pitch
# NEGATIVE, the OPPOSITE of the simplified estimate above. Distance-invariant and
# much less contaminated by jaw movement (~35% of a head-down signal vs ~68%).
# Used when a pose baseline exists; otherwise the simplified gate above applies,
# so users calibrated before solvePnP was added keep working until they recalibrate.

# A gaze-direction gate was tried here too, on the theory that looking at a
# keyboard is done with the eyes more than the head. Measured gaze delta with
# the head down was -0.0036 — the eyes look UP within the socket to keep the
# screen in view, so gaze_y does not cleanly indicate "looking down". Removed
# rather than kept with a guessed sign; see the memory note about keeping
# content out of the lower screen area, which addresses this by layout instead.
