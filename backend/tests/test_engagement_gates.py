"""
Regression tests for the "looking down" gate in the engagement detectors.

Why this file exists
--------------------
The head-pose sign was implemented backwards THREE times. Each time the result
was the same: the gate became dead code, and fatigue accumulated while the user
was actively typing and looking at their keyboard.

The last attempt was "verified" by a synthetic test that built its own rotation
and then measured it — so it confirmed the assumption it was written from rather
than describing what a real camera produces.

These tests therefore use the LIVE MEASURED value from a real session:

    typing, looking at a keyboard  ->  solvePnP pitch delta = +7 degrees

Head down is POSITIVE. If someone flips this again, these fail immediately.

Run from backend/:   python -m pytest tests/ -v
