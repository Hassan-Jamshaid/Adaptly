"""
Brow-furrow measurement (provisional — reports only, does not change state).

Why this exists
---------------
Furrowing the forehead is the clearest visible confusion signal, but in
practice it reads as Focused most of the time. That is not a bug: Struggling
recall is only 10-18% (PROJECT_CONTEXT section 5), and the model's two brow
features are exactly what lifted it from ~1% to that range (section 4). The
signal is present but weak.

Why this does NOT override the state yet
----------------------------------------
Fatigued, Recovered and Deep Thinking are states the model cannot produce at
all, so a rule is the only way to get them. Struggling IS a model class.
A rule that forces Struggling would partly bypass the model on its most
product-critical output, so it should not be switched on from a guessed
threshold. This module therefore MEASURES and reports, so the threshold can be
set from real observations, and the override can be enabled deliberately
afterwards.

What it measures
----------------
Furrowing pulls the inner eyebrows together and lowers them, so both
`inter_brow` (inner-brow separation) and `brow_raise` (brow-to-eye distance)
shrink. Both are reported as a ratio against the DAiSEE Focused reference.
Calibration has already rebased the user onto that scale, so 1.0 means "at
your own resting baseline" and lower means "more furrowed".

FURROW_RATIO_MAX below is an UNVALIDATED starting guess, like the Deep
Thinking constants. Tune it by watching the live readout while furrowing.
