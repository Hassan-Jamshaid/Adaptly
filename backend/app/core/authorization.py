"""
Role-based authorization dependencies.

`get_current_user` proves WHO the caller is. It does not prove what they are
allowed to do. Until now the backend had no role check anywhere, so every
protection was enforced only by the frontend route guards — and a frontend
guard is trivially bypassed by calling the API directly with a valid token.

These dependencies close that gap. Use them on any endpoint that should be
restricted, for example:

    @router.get("/hr/completion-report")
    def report(user=Depends(require_hr_admin)):
        ...

They read the profile from MongoDB rather than trusting anything in the request,
so a caller cannot influence their own role by editing the payload.
